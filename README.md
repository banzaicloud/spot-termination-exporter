## Spot instance termination exporter

Prometheus [exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters) are used to export metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics - this is an exporter to scrape for AWS spot price termination notice on the instance for [Hollowtrees](https://github.com/banzaicloud/hollowtrees).

### Spot instance lifecycle

* User submits a bid to run a desired number of EC2 instances of a particular type. The bid includes the price that the user is willing to pay to use the instance for an hour.
* If the bid price exceeds the current spot price (that is determined by AWS based on current supply and demand) the instances are started.
* If the current spot price rises above the bid price or there is no available capacity, the spot instance is interrupted and reclaimed by AWS. 2 minutes before the interruption the internal metadata endpoint on the instance is updated with the termination info.
* If the instance is interrupted the action taken by AWS varies depending on the interruption behaviour (start, stop or hibernate) and the request type (one-time or persistent). These can be configured when requesting the instance. See more about this [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#creating-spot-request-status)

### Spot instance termination notice

The Termination Notice is accessible to code running on the instance via the instance’s metadata at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/spot/termination-time`. This field becomes available when the instance has been marked for termination and will contain the time when a shutdown signal will be sent to the instance’s operating system.
At that time, the Spot Instance Request’s bid status will be set to `marked-for-termination.`
The bid status is accessible via the `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` API for use by programs that manage Spot bids and instances.

### Spot instance rebalance recommendations

[Rebalance recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/rebalance-recommendations.html) are advance notice that a given spot instance is at elevated risk of spot disruption, they can either be accessed via AWS EventBridge or via the instance metadata endpoint. A number of AWS tools automatically handle rebalance recommendations, for instance [EKS managed node groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html#managed-node-group-capacity-types).

### Quick start

The project uses the [promu](https://github.com/prometheus/promu) Prometheus utility tool. To build the exporter `promu` needs to be installed. To install promu and build the exporter:

```bash
go get github.com/prometheus/promu
promu build
```

The following options can be configured when starting the exporter:

```bash
./spot-termination-exporter --help
Usage of ./spot-termintation-exporter:
  -bind-addr string
        bind address for the metrics server (default ":9189")
  -log-level string
        log level (default "info")
  -metadata-endpoint string
        metadata endpoint to query (default "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/")
  -metrics-path string
        path to metrics endpoint (default "/metrics")

```

### Test locally

The AWS instance metadata is available at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`. By default this is the endpoint that is being queried by the exporter but it is quite hard to reproduce a termination notice or rebalance recommendation on an AWS instance for testing, so the meta-data endpoint can be changed in the configuration.
There is a test server in the `utils` directory that can be used to mock the behavior of the metadata endpoint. It listens on port 9092 and provides dummy responses for `/instance-id`, `/spot/instance-action`, `instance-type`, and `events/recommendations/rebalance`. It can be started with:

```bash
go run util/test_server.go
```

The exporter can be started with this configuration to query this endpoint locally:

```bash
./spot-termination-exporter --metadata-endpoint http://localhost:9092/latest/meta-data/ --log-level debug
```
